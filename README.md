Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on CRNT.jl a suit of functions to study reaction networks.
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning CRNT :)
- ğŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on many things, ask me about it!
- ğŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with a function to convert polynomilas between DynamicalPolynomials.jl and AbstractAlgebra.jl
- ğŸ“« How to reach me: brust at math dot ku dot dk
- ğŸ˜„ Pronouns: she/her
